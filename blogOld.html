            <h1>Hypercubes and Other Stranger Things</h1>
            <h2>Our Very First Breaking Math Minisode</h2>
            <p>We are proud to announce that we have recorded very first minisode! If you have iTunes, you can get it <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/minisode-0-1-hypercubes-and-other-stranger-things/id1201114838?i=1000383483653&mt=2">here</a>, or <a href="https://soundcloud.com/breakingmathpodcast/01-hypercube-and-other-stranger-things">here</a> if you prefer Soundcloud. In addition, we are introducing a new blog that will accompany the minisodes and the regular episodes! The blog will be written by the hosts that are on the minisode (Gabriel, Jonathan, and sometimes other guests) and will include a very brief summary of the content of the minisode as well as some possible expansions or clarifications as needed.</p>
            <p>Not only can you listen to the podcast on your preferred podcast player, but you can now read a brief summary of the content here! We will also be including citations to papers we refer to, diagrams, videos, and other links.</p>
            <p>Finally, if you would like to give us feedback about the minisodes, you can go to the breaking math discussions group on facebook (Note: it is a private group, so you will have to request permission to be added. We will most likely add you... If you’re cool. ) We welcome your questions, comments, or corrections (Just remember to start your corrections with, “Um, well, actually...“).</p>

            <h3>What is a minisode?</h3>
            <p>A minisode is a brief episode that is unplanned, unscripted, and mostly unedited (and also recorded on our computers rather than in studio, so it may suffer from less-than-stellar quality). It serves to give listeners a genuine look at who we are and how we interact in our natural habitat. Topics include ideas for main episodes, humorous anecdotes, behind-the-scenes news, etc. Each minisode includes material recorded both in studio and at our homes (or in our car) on our smart devices.</p>
            <h3>Minisode 1: Part 1 (0:23-7:53)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>HyperCube Applet!</b>
                    <br/>Jonathan <b>(J)</b> made a new applet of a colorful hypercube rotating in space. See it at <a href="/hypercube.html">this link</a>.</li>
                <li><b>Flatland Discussed!</b>
                    <br/>The book Flatland was released in 1884 and discusses the differences between life in two and three dimensions. Jonathan and Gabriel (J and G) discuss why this is relevant and how it relates to hypercubes.</li>
                <li><b>N-Dimensions in Space</b>b>
                    <br/>J and G discuss 0 and 1 dimensional space.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Studio Break (7:54-14:44)</h3>
            <p>For the break, we return to the studio, where we recorded episode 6 Word with guests Zachary Bigger, Owen Martin, and Mark Galik.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Language use in popular science fiction series Ender’s Game, Speaker for the Dead, and Xenocide </li>
                <li>In this series, several different languages and even different modes of communication exist for various lifeforms in the universe.</li>
                <li>These differences in languages and modes of communication between different life forms leads to conflict and misunderstanding.</li>
                <li>Owen talks about the differences between modes of human communication, and how in other cultures there are two words for “our” or “us” (the speaker and the person to whom they are speaking versus the speaker and another person entirely).</li>
                <li>Owen talks about Human Experience and ‘levels of foreignness.’ Language is a way to delineate experiences.</li>
            </ul>

                    <br/>How Stranger Things (Netflix show) describes extra spacial dimensions using an analogy that involved a cable. J and G talk about how science fiction falls into the trap of speaking of extra dimensions as other places.</li>
                <li><b>Life in Hyperspace</b> Living on the surface of a four-dimensional hypercube is visualized.</li>
                <li><b>How Big a Bang?</b> Gabriel wonders how soon after the big bang (started at a single point in space) did three spatial dimensions become the apparent norm.</li>
                <li><b>Knot Funny</b> Knots in less than and more than three dimensions are discussed.</li>
            </ul>
            <img width="500" src="images/hypercube.png">
            <h3>tl;dr: (Too Long; Didn't Read)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Hypercubes are trippy; see for yourself!.</li>
                <li>Different languages lead to misunderstandings and conflict, as seen in the Ender’s Game series. </li>
                <li>Stranger Things mixes up alternate universes and extra dimensions, but is still awesome.</li>

                <h1>How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love Partial Differential Equations</h1>
                <h4>by <b>Gabriel Hesch</b></h4>
                <p>Monday, December 26th</p>
                <p>My name is Gabriel Hesch. I am a former educator (taught grades K--8 for five years, including science and math at the middle school level for 3 years). Recently, I went back to school to finish my master’s degree in electrical engineering at UNM. I was fortunate enough one day to sit by Jonathan Baca in the SUB one day, when I asked him if I could charge my computer using the wall outlet that was near his chair. After he noticed that I was working on some coursework in Digital Logic Design, he informed me that he tutored this subject as well as other subjects too (mathematics in general, computer science, others. SEE HIS RESUME; this guy is amazing! And reasonably priced too. There you go Jonathan, I just plugged you. See ;) (For you grammar nazis, here’s your end paren)).</p>
                <p>While Jonathan helped me not only survive my digital logic class, but to understand it well, be began bonding over what makes for effective teaching pedagogy and what are some of the challenges students often face, particularly in the STEM fields. Because I had a prior background in education and Jonathan had prior experience as a tutor, this led to many fruitful discussions.</p>
                <p>After two years of tutoring sessions and long conversations on the strangeness and awesomeness of mathematics, we came up with the idea of doing a podcast together. Although we have many shared interests, we decided to make the focus of the podcast on mathematics first, and then to branch out into other subjects later (we all know the popular saying that physics is simply applied math, chemistry is simply applied physics, biology is applied chemistry, and on and on). Our aim is to make the subject matter both interesting as well as highly accessible to a lay audience of approximately 8th grade (which is the grade level that I used to teach). We decided on ten episodes on subject areas that were chosen very deliberately (you can read about these on this website). We are hoping that through this podcast, we may increase an appreciation for mathematics as a whole in an audience that may or may not already have an intrinsic appreciation for the subject. </p>
                <p>I think it is worth mentioning that we highly value feedback. We look forward from our listeners about our show. Please let us know your thoughts on topics we chose, the show, or just how your day is going ; ). Here are some sample questions that we would be very interested in hearing about:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Did we do a good job with explaining the topics?
                    </li>
                    <li>For all you smarty-pants subject matter experts (mathemagicians, engineers, etc.), did we do the topics justice? That is:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Did we adequately and thoroughly explain the concepts?
                            </li>
                            <li>Were the analogies helpful?
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Is there anything that you could explain better? We’d love to know! Send us your opinion, and you may get a shout out! </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Thank you SO much for stopping by! Enjoy the show!

                <h1>Who "I" Is, and Other Relevant Questions</h1>
                <h4>by <b>Jonathan Baca</b></h4>
                <p>Monday, December 26th</p>
                <p>Welcome to the Breaking Math Podcast blog. Here, me, <a href="about.html#gabriel">Gabriel Hesch</a>, and maybe some guest bloggers are going to write some relevant thoughts about what we're doing, going to do, thinking about, and other such information.
                </p>
                <p>Let me begin by sort of explaining why I wanted to do the podcast in the first place. Me and Gabriel were finishing up a tutoring session one day, and we found out that we both enjoyed podcasts quite a lot, and we sort of both organically came up with the idea of the Breaking Math Podcast.</p>
                <p>So we have some episodes planned, and I'm going to lay them out for you: <b>Warning: possible spoilers ahead!</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Forbidden Formulas</b></li>
                        <p>This is gonna be an episode about how elitism in math has shaped the way math has been taught. You can check out a preview <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-644916311/001-forbidden-formulas-preview">here</a>.</p>
                        <li><b>Chaos and Fractals</b></li>
                        <p>This episode is going to be all about chaotic systems and fractals. We're making this episode because there's a lot of misinformation surrounding these beautiful mathematical structures that have changed that way that people have viewed science itself in the last century or so. We're gonna have some audio samples that illustrate, auditorally, fractals like this one: <img class="thumbnail" width="33%" src="images/mandelbrot.png"></p>
                        <li><b>Information Theory</b></li>
                        <p>This episode is gonna be about stuff. All stuff! Basically, since everything is information, this is, in a weird way, a theory that you can apply to everything from quantum mechanics to language to fractals, etc. For example, in English, there's about one bit of information per letter, which means that, when you compress a file, you can usually get it down to about 1/8th of its size (in ASCII, there are 8 bits per letter, for historical reasons that will be explained in the episode or the paper thereof).</p>
                        <li><b>Science and Math</b></li>
                        <p>Science sometimes make predictions about math, because the math it makes is useful (as is seen in the Fourier series), and sometimes the other way around (such as in matrices and how they apply to quantum mechanics).</p>
                        <li><b>Proofs and Philosophy</b></li>
                        <p>We're gonna talk about how stuff is proven, a little bit about the history thereof, when proofs break down, and even have a few examples. Proofs are the bedrock of mathematics; without them, all you have is numerology.</p>
                        <p>In this episode, <i>gedankenexperiment</i> (or <i>thought experiment</i>), the concept of doing experiments in your own mind before doing them in the real world, will be covered.</p>
                        <li><b>Game Theory</b></li>
                        <p>A fun episode about the theory behind games like chess, negotiation strategy, etc.. We'll go over the prisoner's dilemma (more information can be found on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma">Wikipedia Page about it</a>), and other fun thought experiments.</p>
                        <li><b>History of Computation</b></li>
                        <p>We're gonna start with tally marks, and go all the way to quantum computers on this one. This episode's gonna be sort of a fun one for a lot of people, but be no less informative or accessible than any of the other episodes.</p>
                        <li><b>Consciousness</b></li>
                        <p>This one's a doozy, and might even be a two-parter. Not to spoil anything, but we're gonna cover the math behind reason and consciousness itself. For those who are more well-acquainted with the topic and assert that what we're doing is impossible, we urge you to stay tuned.</p>
                        <li><b>Recreational Math</b></li>
                        <p>Whew! We're gonna end with a fun episode about how to have fun with math itself (a concept that is laughable to a lot of people, but we're hoping to change that attitude).</p>
                        <p></p>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>We're very happy to have you here, and we urge you to <a href="subscribe.html"><b>subscribe</b></a> to our podcast on Soundcloud. And we're very thankful to <a href="http://kunm.org">KUNM</a> for helping us out with the equipment, editing, and other technical things.</p>
